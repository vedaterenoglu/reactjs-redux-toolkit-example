--STRATEGIC COMPONENT DECOMPOSITION

OBJECTIVE
Decompose /categories route into maintainable, reusable, testable React components following SOLID principles.
ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

ASSESS: Current component structure, dependencies, complexity
MAP: UI elements, business logic, data flow, state management
IDENTIFY: Reusable patterns and separation opportunities
PLAN: Component hierarchy and migration strategy

DECOMPOSITION FRAMEWORK
Component Levels

ATOMIC: Buttons, inputs, badges (smallest units)
MOLECULAR: Form fields, search bars, cards
ORGANISM: Complete forms, data tables, panels
TEMPLATE: Page layouts, containers

Architecture Pattern
/components/admin/city/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ containers/     # Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/   # UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ atoms/         # Basic elements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/         # Custom hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/         # TypeScript interfaces
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/         # Helper functions
MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS

‚úÖ Follow SOLID principles strictly (DO)
‚úÖ Create TypeScript interfaces for all props (DO)
‚úÖ Separate business logic from presentation (DO)
‚úÖ Design for testability and reusability (DO)
‚ùå NEVER exceed 100 lines per component (NOT DO)
‚ùå NEVER mix concerns in single component (NOT DO)

VERIFICATION:

 Each component has single responsibility
 All props have TypeScript interfaces
 Business logic isolated in hooks/containers
 Components are independently testable

üö´ FORBIDDEN

‚ùå NEVER use prop drilling beyond 2 levels (NOT DO)
‚ùå NEVER create tightly coupled components (NOT DO)
‚ùå NEVER skip unit tests for components (NOT DO)
‚ùå NEVER ignore accessibility standards (NOT DO)
‚úÖ Use composition over inheritance (DO)
‚úÖ Implement proper error boundaries (DO)

VERIFICATION:

 No prop drilling violations
 Components work independently
 Test coverage > 80%
 Accessibility audit passed

‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

‚úÖ Average component size < 100 lines (DO)
‚úÖ Test coverage > 80% (DO)
‚úÖ Components reused in 2+ places (DO)
‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns (DO)
‚úÖ Performance maintained/improved (DO)
‚ùå NEVER compromise code quality (NOT DO)

VERIFICATION:

 Component complexity metrics met
 Test coverage report generated
 Reusability audit completed
 Performance benchmarks passed

DELIVERABLES

Component Analysis Report: Current state assessment
Decomposition Plan: File structure and hierarchy
Interface Definitions: All TypeScript interfaces
Migration Timeline: Phased implementation
Test Strategy: Unit and integration approaches
